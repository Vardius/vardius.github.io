Welcome, I am a Senior Software Engineer, a graduate of Computer Science at the [Faculty of Electronics](http://weka.pwr.edu.pl/en/), [Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology](http://pwr.edu.pl/en/) where I did both my Bachelor and Masters degrees. Full stack software developer with lot of experience. Knowing the highest programming method and cutting edge technologies. I am constantly striving to learn new technologies and looking for ways to better myself in this rapidly changing industry. Beside working full time I am doing [open source projects](https://rafallorenz.com/open-source/) and develop my own applications. I am dedicated to my craft and I am proud of my code. I am trying to write beautiful, efficient code to a high standard, in a timely and scalable way that improves the code-base of products in meaningful ways.
